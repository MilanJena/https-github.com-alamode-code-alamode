# Ver. 2.0.0 (2026-10-30)

ALAMODE follows Semantic Versioning from this release on: incompatible changes to input tags, file formats, or the Python API increase the major version.

## Breaking changes and changed defaults

- **anphon** `FCSXML`/`FC2XML` renamed `FCSFILE`/`FC2FILE`; the old names are rejected.
- **anphon** `NKD` and `NSYM` removed (inputs with them stop); `KD` optional, taken from FCSFILE.
- **anphon** New `&kappa` field: `ISOTOPE`, `ISOFACT`, `KAPPA_SPEC`, `KAPPA_COHERENT` moved there from `&analysis` (rejected in `&analysis`); `RESTART`/`RESTART_4PH` moved there (still accepted in `&general` with a warning).
- **anphon** `MODE = RTA` renamed `MODE = kappa` with the `SOLVER` tag; `MODE = RTA` accepted with a warning.
- **anphon** `FSTATE_K` removed; `kplane` option removed.
- **anphon** `ISOTOPE = 1` by default (the kappa of natural Si at 300 K is about 7 % lower than with `ISOTOPE = 0`).
- **anphon** `TREVSYM` (default 1): time-reversal symmetry in the k-point reduction; restart files of the other setting are rejected.
- **anphon** SCPH mixing default `IMIX = 1` (DIIS); `IMIX = 0` = 1.5 simple mixing.
- **anphon** HDF5 restart/result files by default: PREFIX.kappa.h5, PREFIX.scph.h5, PREFIX.qha.h5; `FILE_FORMAT = text` keeps the legacy .result/.scph_dymat/.renorm_harm_dymat (deprecated); legacy files are imported once.
- **anphon** `PRINTEVEC` writes `.evec.h5` (was `.evec.hdf5` + text `.evec`); text only with `FILE_FORMAT = text`; NEWFCS writes `PREFIX_+.h5`/`PREFIX_-.h5`.
- **anphon** Unconverged SCPH/QHA temperatures recorded; later runs refuse them unless `ALLOW_UNCONVERGED = 1`; their thermo/DOS/MSD rows are NaN unless `ALLOW_UNCONVERGED = 1`.
- **anphon** `RENORM_2TO1ST`/`RENORM_34TO1ST`/`RENORM_3TO2ND` replaced by `STRAIN_COUPLING` (default 7); old tags accepted with a warning, they will be removed in a later release.
- **anphon** `COOLING_U0_INDEX`/`COOLING_U0_THR` deprecated and ignored; `SET_INIT_STR = 3` detects the high-symmetry phase with spglib.
- **anphon** `KS_INPUT` deprecated in favour of `MODE = selfenergy`.
- **anphon** Group velocities for kappa from the velocity matrix of degenerate blocks (basis invariant), little-group symmetrization, zero Gamma translational velocities; restarting from an older kappa.h5 recomputes kappa.
- **anphon** `BCONNECT` matches bands by eigenvectors and frequencies (frequency only across path breaks) and applies to SCPH/QHA bands (GitHub #309).
- **anphon** HDF5 FCS `unit` attributes honoured.
- **anphon** `&cell` optional when the HDF5 FCSFILE contains the primitive cell; stricter cell checks (cell must tile the FCS supercell, handedness, skewed supercell rejected with NONANALYTIC = 2, exact BORNINFO count).
- **anphon** `.scph_dfc2` corrections are relative to the full harmonic dynamical matrix (header `DELTA_BASELINE = 1`); 1.x `.scph_dymat` converted for NONANALYTIC = 2/3, refused for 1.
- **alm** `PREFIX.h5` is the only default output; `.xml` and `.fcs` need `FCS_ALAMODE = 1`.
- **alm** `FCSYM_BASIS = Cartesian` by default (was Lattice); XML FC2FIX/FC3FIX files keep their recorded basis; warning for imprecise input structures.
- **alm** `FC2XML`/`FC3XML` renamed `FC2FIX`/`FC3FIX` (old names warn).
- **alm** `NAT`, `NKD` optional (inferred from &position / KD / STRUCTURE_FILE).
- **alm** Displacement-pattern files in YAML by default; `FORMAT_PATTERN = old` keeps the 1.5 format.
- **alm** ShengBTE outputs named `PREFIX.FORCE_CONSTANTS_3RD`/`_4TH` (was `FORCE_CONSTANT_3RD`); warn when NORDER is too small.
- **alm** Numerical `ICONST = 2-4` drop nearly dependent constraint rows by `TOL_CONST`; algebraic `ICONST = 12-14` with `ALGO_REDUCTION = 3` use scale-free rank + threshold pivoting and now match 2-4.
- **alm** Python API default `TOL_CONST = 1e-6`, as in the CLI.
- **alm** Order of rows in `/ForceConstants` independent of round-off; FC orders without nonzero IFCs written as empty datasets.
- **alm/anphon/tools** CODATA 2018 physical constants throughout.
- **alm/anphon** Stricter input validation: malformed inputs that were accepted or crashed are errors (DFSET 6 finite numbers per line, ICONST whitelist, range checks, numeric parsing, `&kpoint` numbers, EMIN/EMAX honoured by DOS, KMESH_COARSE checks, extra &cutoff columns warn, only tokens starting with N mean None in &cutoff).
- **alm/anphon** WARNING/ERROR messages word-wrapped at 90 columns.
- **tools** `analyze_phonons.{py,cpp}` replaced by `analyzer.py` (reads `--h5 PREFIX.kappa.h5`, `--3ph PREFIX.result`).
- **tools** `makedisp_qe.py` removed (use `displace.py --QE`).
- **tools** `displace.py --random_normalcoord`: sigma capping by nearest-neighbour distance, 4 sigma truncation, 10 cm^-1 frequency floor, fixed default seed.
- **docs** Hosted on GitHub Pages with the Breeze theme.

- `alm` compatible with phonopy's ALM interface.
- Errors raised as Python exceptions instead of exiting.

### tools
- `analyzer.py` (replaces analyze_phonons), reads kappa.h5, modified-log-linear interpolation, |v| and mfp output.

## Performance

- **alm** Constraint reduction overhaul (coord factorization, SPQR, forward elimination + back-substitution, OpenMP), much faster for large models.
- **alm** Faster sensing-matrix construction, CD Gram via GEMM, standardized adaptive LASSO, normal-equation OLS weights; efficient cluster generation.
- **anphon** SCPH: DIIS, V4 kernel memory halved, row-distributed V4 over MPI, GEMM-based V3/V4 builders, zheevd for large cells, O(nk ns^3) forces/stress and free-energy postprocess (setup 325 -> 70 s, postprocess 373 -> 3 s per T on a clathrate).
- **anphon** Faster 3ph/4ph scattering rates, OpenMP over triplets/quartets, batched tetrahedron weights.
- **anphon** 4ph kernel skips the (c d) atom pairs with no fourth-order IFC (large cells: Re4Si7 455 -> 348 s, 1.5x per mode for a 54-atom clathrate; unchanged for 2-atom cells).
- **anphon** Isotope scattering with the tetrahedron method much faster (Re4Si7 131 -> 7 s).
- **anphon** k-parallel harmonic diagonalization and interpolation; diagonalize once across ranks.
- **anphon** Improved Ewald summation; FFTW replaced by direct DFT.

- **anphon** Boundary scattering and adaptive smearing in the IBTE solver; 4ph scattering rate bug; inconsistent kl4 between anphon and analyzer.py.
- **anphon** IFC lattice vectors taken from the run's primitive cell (FC2 from SCPH state + FC3 from alm gave wrong kappa, Ba8Ga16Ge30 0.058 vs 0.82 W/mK).
- **anphon** Complete minimum-image search for skewed cells; consistent gauge and harmonic baseline for NONANALYTIC != 0.
- **anphon** Symmetric, ASR-consistent strain derivatives of IFCs; Green-Lagrange strain in the strain-energy expansion.
- **anphon** SCP forces/stress exact derivatives of the interpolated model; symmetric SCPH/QHA FC2 corrections.
- **anphon** ASR check and minimum image detection; acoustic-mode identification at Gamma from eigenvectors.
- **anphon** Many MPI broadcast fixes (TOLERANCE, RELAX_STR, ADAPTIVE_FACTOR, ISMEAR_4PH, LEN_BOUNDARY, TRISYM, element names, QHA IALGO) and rank-dependent IFC order with NEWFCS = 1.
- **anphon** FC3FILE/FC4FILE handling; empty FC3/FC4 arrays; restart problems on some platforms; TMAX dropped from the temperature grid by round-off; temperature index rounding.
- **anphon** Silent wrong results, MPI hangs and input checks found in review; heap overflow broadcasting an empty symmetry list.
- **alm** Bugs in `set_fc_zero_threshold`, `fix_constraint`, equivalent-site detection, supercell symmetry update; NDATA_CV guess and manual CV alphas; ALGO_REDUCTION not passed.
- **alm** Constraint rank reduction; RREF sub-tolerance leftovers crash; Huang constraint looked up FC2 with the wrong atom index; elastic-net CD update; NaN CV scores for pattern DFSETs and cluster-search overrun; stop when every KKT solver fails.
- **alm** Uninitialized `symmetry_tolerance` and the lattice convention of the Python API.
- **tools** POSCAR element order; cell mapping in fcsio/taylor; QE `!` comments; temperature-grid counting in Python readers.

## Build / packaging

- C++17; CMake (>= 3.17, CMake 4 supported) is the only build system, the legacy Makefiles are removed.
- HDF5 and spglib required (anphon uses spglib); FFTW3 no longer needed; Boost >= 1.66, fewer Boost components.
- Optional backends `USE_MKL_BACKEND` (LP64 only), `USE_ACCEL_BACKEND`, `USE_SUITESPARSE_BACKEND`, `USE_EIGEN_BLAS`.
- `make install` / `cmake --install` for binaries and Python scripts; anphon built as a static library.
- Python package built with scikit-build-core + nanobind; header-only Boost fallback.
- conda environment file `etc/alamode-environment.yml` (includes SuiteSparse); PyYAML added to requirements.
- Unit tests off by default.
- CI: GitHub Actions (Si, ZnO, BaTiO3, tools, Python), sanitizer workflow, pre-commit (clang-format, ruff), self-hosted runners, cheap tests per push / expensive nightly.
